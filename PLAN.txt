How you would use your software to make money?


What are we selling?
We are going to host the server ourselves and users can connect via the GUI and will be able to choose to play
against an AI or against the next user that connects.

Our game will be free for basic users. But we will be able to make money on advertisements and upgrading
basic users.

Who are we selling to?
We will be selling to the general public to be users and we will be selling advertisement space
to larger companies. Refunds won't be offered because clients can use the free version before
committing to pay for the full version.

Getting licensed?
We will be going to a lawyer who specializes in the industry for a software licensing. We will also
be talking to our lawyer about how to Copyright our work so that we will always hold the intellectual
property of the code. We will talk about any liability issues with the lawyer.

Support?
We will have a team that will keep the checking, updating, and upgrading the server and the software and fix any reported bugs.
This team will also be able to assist clients if they are having issues with the software or connecting to the server.
